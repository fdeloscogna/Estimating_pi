# Estimating_pi
Algorithm to simulate and find pi using Monte Carlo Simulation
In this notebook, $\pi$ is estimated by using Monte Carlo simulation. The existstence of the constant called $\pi$ is commonly been taken for granted and is usually computed by using the area of the circle formula $\pi$*$r^2$. Instead, the project's aim is show how to get a precise value of $\pi$ by using simulations tools.
